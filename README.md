### Hi there 🙋🏻‍♂️

I'm a seasoned software developer with over 12 years of experience. I am also a full-stack web developer, with expertise on all kinds of technologies ranging from React.js to PHP frameworks such as Laravel & CodeIgniter[.](https://discord.gg/H3eMUXp)

Over my programming journey, I've experimented with many different programming and scripting languages, including Java, C#, C++, C, Go, JavaScript, Lua, among others. I've also implemented enterprise applications for customers on many of them.

If you're developing an application, software, or website, write me a message and I'll gladly contribute small ideas and possibly guidance during my free time. The best way to get in touch with me is by [joining my Discord server](https://discord.gg/H3eMUXp) or by adding me directly on Discord: `🌌λtlas#9352`.
